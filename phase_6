LAB: Bar Point of Sale - Phase 6
We are going to build the back-end for a Bar Point of Sale machine. The Bar POS back-end will need to track products, inventory bottles, and orders. When an order is made, the inventory should automatically be adjusted and our bar manager should be notified when a product we sell is running out.
This lab is broken into multiple phases.
Phase 6 Requirements
For phase 6 we will focus on generating reports.
Create report routes:
the most ordered product
daily sales
profit per product
the total available liquid for each product
employee of the month (employee with the most total sales for a month)
