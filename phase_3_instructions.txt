# LAB: Bar Point of Sale - Phase 3
We are going to build the back-end for a Bar Point of Sale machine. The Bar POS back-end
will need to track products, inventory bottles, and orders. When an order is made, the inventory
should automatically be adjusted and our bar manager should be notified when a product we sell
is running out.
This lab is broken into multiple phases.
## Phase 3 Requirements
For phase 3 we will concentrate on the `Order` model.
## CRUD
You can only create, get all, and get by id for an order. The `Order` model should include
an invoice (array of products and amounts), totalSalePrice, and timestamps
// Need a function that will calculate price of sale
* the create route will be used when a new sale is made
* the get all route will be used to see all sales made (include only _id and createdAt)
* the get by id route will be used to get details about an order (populate products)
## Functionality
* when creating an order calculate the totalSalePrice based on products and amounts
* when creating an order update a bottles remaining liquid
  * If there is not enough liquid in the bottle take liquid from multiple bottles
  * If there is not enough liquid in all bottles send an error
  * If a bottles remaining liquid is zero, delete the bottle
* when creating an order send notification if totalRemainingLiquid is less than
  half a bottle
## Testing
* `supertest` to test all your routes
## Rubric
* 0.5 point per route
* 0.5 point per route test
* 1 points for populate
* 2 points for calculate totalSalePrice
* 4 points for taking liquid from multiple bottles
* 2 points for handling error when there is not enough liquid
* 2 points from deleting empty bottles
* 6 points for sending a notification if totalRemaining Liquid is less tha
  half a bottle
